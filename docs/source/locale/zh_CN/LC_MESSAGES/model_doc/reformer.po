"*Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a"
" number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, "
"especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the "
"efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by "
"one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from "
"O(L^2) to O(Llog(L)), where L is the length of the sequence. Furthermore,"
" we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, "
"which allows storing activations only once in the training process "
"instead of N times, where N is the number of layers. The resulting model,"
" the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much "
"more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.*"
